# Chicago Police Data Analysis

The "few bad apples" hypothesis claims that police misconduct is primarily
caused by a small number of highly frequent violators. This hypothesis is
important because it informs policy decisions â€” if true, police departments
will more effectively improve overall police behavior by identifying and
removing "bad apples" instead of retraining their entire taskforce.

If the "few bad apples" hypothesis is true, we expect to find that:

1. Police with at least one complaint are likely to have multiple complaints.
2. An officer's number of past complaints predicts their likelihood of
   receiving future complaints.

I test the two hypotheses above by examining historical patterns of complaints
within the Chicago Police Department using data provided by the [Invisible
Institute][ii].
