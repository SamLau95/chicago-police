    "For this project, I use the data on Chicago Police Department complaints provided by the Invisible Institute ([https://invisible.institute/police-data](https://invisible.institute/police-data)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data were made public in response to the widely publicized reports of police violence of the past few decades, a number of which occurred in Chicago, Illinois. In 2007, a writer named Jamie Kalven and a professor of law at the University of Chicago named Craig Futterman filed a lawsuit against the city of Chicago in 2007 to force the city to release complaint records files against the police department.\n",
    "\n",
    "After seven years of litigation, Kalven received a ruling that gave public access to nearly all available records stored by the Chicago Police Department (CPD), including officer rosters, complaints filed against officers, and rulings made by the Police Department on these complaints. Numerous articles were published about the striking patterns that the data revealed:\n",

    "- [Police Abuse Complaints By Black Chicagoans Dismissed Nearly 99 Percent Of The Time](http://data.huffingtonpost.com/2015/12/chicago-officer-misconduct-allegations)\n",
    "- [Chicago Pays Millions but Punishes Few in Killings by Police](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/us/chicago-pays-millions-but-punishes-few-in-police-killings.html)\n",

    "The data are publicly available as CSV and zipfiles on GitHub ([https://github.com/invinst/chicago-police-data](https://github.com/invinst/chicago-police-data)). They include more than 240,000 allegations of misconduct over the past fifty years. In particular, the data form a census of complaints filed against the CPD from 2000 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data record complaints, rosters of police officers, salaries of officers, and CPD awards given to officers. The entire dataset is 85 MiB unzipped. In this report, I examine the data on complaints and police officers. Much of this analysis is based on a 538 article called [How To Predict Bad Cops In Chicago](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-predict-which-chicago-cops-will-commit-misconduct/)."
